I am happy to announce the release of Présentation.app 1.4.

Présentation.app is a presentation tool for pdf slides (e.g. produced using LaTeX and the popular beamer class) for Mac OS X.
You can download this release here: http://iihm.imag.fr/blanch/software/osx-presentation/releases/


Its most notable features are:

+ a presenter view displaying
  - the current and next slide
  - a timer
  - the notes associated to the current slide

+ hyperlinks do work
  - internal links (e.g. navigation links generated by beamer) work
  - links to local video files open the video on the presentation screen
  - links to other files are opened in a webview on the presentation screen

+ usable
  - from the command line (as it is a Python script)
  - from the Finder (as it accepts dropping a PDF file to launch the app)
