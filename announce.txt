I am happy to announce the release of Présentation.app 2.2.0.

Présentation.app is a presentation tool for pdf slides (e.g. produced using LaTeX and the popular beamer class) for Mac OS X.
You can download this release here: http://iihm.imag.fr/blanch/software/osx-presentation/releases/


Its most notable features are:

+ a presenter view displaying
  - the current and next slide
  - a timer
  - the notes associated to the current slide

+ hyperlinks do work
  - internal links (e.g. navigation links generated by beamer) work
  - links to local video files open the video on the presentation screen
  - links to other files are opened in a webview on the presentation screen

+ usable
  - from the command line (as it is a Python script)
  - from the Finder (as it accepts dropping a PDF file to launch the app)


This release does not introduce new features but fixes issues on Mac OS X 10.15.
It also changes the underlying technology used for video playback, making it ready for future evolutions.
And last, the development moved to a new host, since bitbucket is removing its mercurial support.
Dev is now happening here:
